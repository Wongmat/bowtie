# OOP vs FP

- The difference between OOP and FP is based on the two main elements of their names: Objects and functions. In programming, an object is an abstraction of data that we can usually use to model something in real life (e.g. An employee has a salary, boss, address, etc), while functions are descriptions of PROCESSES (e.g. Adding 2 with some number). The different focus of the two styles makes for two different approaches to programming: In FP, the process and actions are given much more importance than the data while programming, and in OOP the relationships between the data and the processes are much more intertwined. This difference can be illustrated with this example:

## If I wanted to make tea with a program...
###FP Approach:
```
const tea = step([
  () => getWater(50), getTea(1), getSugar(1)],
  mix()
]);
```

###OOP Approach:
```
const water = 100;
const teaLeaves = 50;
const sugar = 30;

const cupOfTea = new Tea(water, teaLeaves, sugar);
cupOfTea.mix();

```

- The difference is very clear from the examples. In the first example, we do not care about the finer details of the ingredients. All we care about is that we want tea, and we have a function step() that requires certain amounts of each to create the product. On the OOP side, we can see that the finer details of everything is recorded. Not only are we making the tea, but we are also keeping track of the amounts of the ingredients. Another difference is that in OOP, most functions are tied to an object (E.g. To mix the tea, we need to access the Tea object) while Anonymous functions with no ties to objects are much more common in FP.
